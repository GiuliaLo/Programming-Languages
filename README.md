For this assignment we had to create a scanner-parser for a simple made up language using JFlex and Java Cup.
I think it's significant in my computer science education because it shows my understanding of the mechanisms behind compilers and the ability to work in a group setting on a challenging project.
The hardest part was figuring out the grammar for the parser (jcup file), especially how the print and input functions had to fit in the picture. Debugging it was also tricky because of the interaction between the scanner and the parser, and it took us a lot of time to fix all of the bugs we had, so weren't able to work on the extra credit questions because we ran out of time.
Working on this project in a group wasn't easy because after the initial brainstorming session where we worked together to decide on the tokens and discussed ideas for the grammar, there wasn't a good way to split the work between us because of how closely dependent each part is to the others, so there was ultimately one person writing the code, even if the other two could make suggestions. I feel like we were able to work well together anyway, and everyone made valuable contributions.
The educational learning goals that I was able to reach with this assignment are collaboration for the college-wide learning goals and for the computer science program
-To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting
-To develop effective problem solving skills.
